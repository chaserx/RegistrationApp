# Registrationapp

April 4, 2012

Chase Southard

Registrationapp is a complete rewrite of the Ruby on Rails based web application that manages the registration of a small symposium when Chase worked at the University of Kentucky. This code is based on http://github.com/chaserx/reggie2, although rewritten for Rails (v 3.2.x).

This was used in production on Heroku for the Symposium for Reproductive Science and Women's Health.
